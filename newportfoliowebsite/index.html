		<h2>Timeless Space</h2>
		<p>
			Created together with Isa-Jane Ensing and Phila Hillie
			<br />
			Inspired by culture, this experience makes participants aware of their personal and subjective experience of time by magnifying and reflecting their bodily (and thereby indirectly mental) experience of time through the measuring of their heartbeat. The heart can be seen as a personal and internal ticking clock. To visualise this bodily experience of time, there is explored how time can be made tangible and influenced. The final experience is an enclosed timless space in which participants can experience their own unique sense of time.

		<h2>Dreamreader</h2>
		<p>
			Created together with Rick Heemskerk
			<br />
			This intelligible AI creature is hooked up to a specialized computer that can accurately analyse the electric signals going through the creature. Optimized for this purpose, the computer can read and project the creature's thoughts, including a glimpse into its dreams when asleep. Interactions with the creature when awake will shape the creature's projected dreams, as well as your own.

		<h2>Bat Experience</h2>
		<p>
			Created together with Yiming Tong and Xiaotian Ma
			<br />
			With various Arduino sensors, this project evokes a new understanding of our physical space and consciousness by adapting the interesting sensory experience that bats have, to humans. Bats navigate their environment using echolocation, they listen to ultrasonic sound that echoes off objects in a space for three-dimensional localization. By using an ultrasonic distance sensor in combination with headphones,  echolocation becomes available to humans. By making the device wearable, humans can navigate through space as a bat. We used various other sensors and motors to make the bat experience complete.
